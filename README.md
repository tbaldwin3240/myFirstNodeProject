# myFirstNodeProject
# Create a Dynamic Website in Node

# Create a new node/express project
# Create an array with artists/places/music cds in app.js
# example

   # let songs = [{  
      # name:"The Carter",
      # publishDate:"2004",
      # imgURL:"images/theCarter.jpg",

     # songTitles:["song1","song2", "song3", "song4"]
   # },
   # {  
      # name:"Free Weezy",
      # description:"2015",
      # imgURL:"images/FreeWeezy.jpg",

     # songTitles:["song1","song2", "song3", "song4"]
   # }
# ]
# Create a front page ('/') that tells about your music artist. Include a couple of pictures

# Create a page that lists all of the cds for the artist. Each CD should be a hyperlink that navigates to a page that corresponds to the index in the json file: For example,

#example ('/cds')

# The Carter
# Free Weezy
# Create a route that takes in arguments on the url that will display one artist/place/music at a time.
# You should have a page that navigates to:

# http://localhost3000:/albums/0

# shows album title, songs and image associated with index 0 of the array of objects
# http://localhost3000:/albums/1

# shows album title, songs and image associated with index 1 of the array of objects
